# SimplePHPImageGallery
This is a very simple .php-file that you can simply put into a folder and it will display the folders' contents in a web browser, easily browsable, as a photo gallery. Folders in the filesystem are folders in the GUI as well.

# Requirements

Nothing, except PHP and the JQuery file.

# Showing links

https://link.com/, name
